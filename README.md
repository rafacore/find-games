# FIND GAMES

This is a platform were you can find games and discover more about them, it was developed based in Reactjs, hooks, react router, CSS-modules and react-query to fetch data from API.

I have used the latest features of Reactjs hooks, react Lazy and JavaScript es6, react-query CSS was also used, CSS-module and CSS grid making the layout more responsive and with a clean look, smooth and without many coding lines.

What could you do better in your code next iteration?

Technically for this version we could add infinite scroll to improve the performance with select-queries and cache information, we could also split more our components

On the business side of it in mind, we could evolve it for a kind of forum where people could share information and help each other, we could also make an app using React native.
